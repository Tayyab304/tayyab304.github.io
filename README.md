## 💫 About Me

iOS Engineer with **3+ years of professional experience** building and maintaining **production-grade native iOS applications** using **Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, and Async/Await**.<br>
Strong expertise in **Clean Architecture** (MVVM, VIPER, MVP), **modular app design**, and **performance optimization** using **Xcode Instruments**.<br><br>

I have delivered multiple iOS apps from **technical analysis and architecture design** through **App Store release and post-launch maintenance**. My work focuses on **scalable codebases**, clean UI implementations aligned with **Apple Human Interface Guidelines**, and measurable performance and stability improvements.<br><br>

I currently pursue a **Master’s degree in Natural Language Processing**, working with **Python-based data pipelines, machine learning models, and statistical analysis**. I am particularly interested in bridging **AI-driven insights** with **real-world mobile applications**, especially in user-centric and data-informed features.
